    "##### Probability Mass Function (PMF) :\n",
    "- PMF describes the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a specific value.\n",
    "- it deals with Discrete random variable\n",
    "- The value of the PMF at a specific point indicates the probability of the random variable taking on that value.\n",
    "- It can be visualised as a bar chart\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example :\n",
    "- Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and sample space is S = [HH,HT,TH,TT]. The probability of getting heads needs to determined. Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. X can take values 0,1,2. \"The Pr(X) = 1 is 0.3\" .Hence we can say that \"Probability Mass Function of X at 1 is 0.3\" \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Probability Density Function (PDF) :\n",
    "- PDF Describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value or falling within a specific interval\n",
    "- It deals with Continuous random variable\n",
    "- The vlaue of PDF at a specific point indicates the probability density, not the probability itself.\n",
    "- the PDF can be visualized with area under the curve representing probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example :\n",
    "- Lets say we have a continuous random variable whose probability density function is given by f(x)= x+2,when 0<x<2. we want to find P(0.5<x<1). Then we integrate x+2 within the limits 0.5 and 1. this gives us 1.375.\n"
